<p><i><h3 style="color:#FF7A59;text-align:justify;font-family:Times New Roman;"> A tree is a tall plant that can live for a very long time. It has a single stem or trunk and branches that support leaves. Beneath the ground, a tree has a root system that acts as an anchor and stores the water and nutrients the plant needs to grow.</h3></p></i>
